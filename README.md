# SOLID
## SOLID for win
### one class must responsible for one purpose only, and has only one reason to change a class
### class is extendsible, not modifiable
### in a program, child class can modify parent object without changing the rightness of program
### the bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction
### higher level's modules should not depend on lower one, both should depend on abstraction(interface), abstraction(interface) should not depend on detail, class communicate by interface, not communicate through implementation
